#Node.js Project

This API is designed for a YouTube clone application, enabling users to upload, retrieve, and manage video content. Each video is associated with an owner (user), and this API allows you to access video details along with user information.
Here’s a list of dependencies you’ll need to install for the backend of your YouTube clone project, along with the commands to install them using npm.

Essential Dependencies
Express: Web framework for Node.js.
Mongoose: MongoDB ODM for managing data models.
dotenv: For environment variable management.
body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
cors: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
Optional (But Commonly Used) Dependencies
jsonwebtoken: For handling JSON Web Tokens if you’re implementing authentication.
bcryptjs: For hashing passwords.
multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data (e.g., file uploads).
nodemon: Development tool for automatically restarting the server.
express-validator: For validating and sanitizing input data.
Installation Commands
Run the following commands in your project directory to install all required dependencies.

bash
# Initialize a new npm project
npm init -y

# Install essential dependencies
npm install express mongoose dotenv body-parser cors

#  Install for authentication and validation
npm install jsonwebtoken bcryptjs multer express-validator

# Install nodemon as a dev dependency
npm install nodemon
Explanation of Dependencies
express: Handles routing and simplifies building the backend server.
mongoose: Interacts with MongoDB, allowing you to define schemas and perform database operations.
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file, helping you keep sensitive information out of the codebase.
body-parser: Parses incoming request bodies so you can access the data in req.body.
cors: Enables communication between the frontend and backend when they are on different domains or ports.
jsonwebtoken: Generates and verifies JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
bcryptjs: Hashes passwords for secure storage.
multer: Facilitates file uploads if you plan to allow users to upload videos.
express-validator: Validates and sanitizes user input to help prevent errors and security issues.
nodemon: Restarts the server automatically whenever changes are made, speeding up the development process.


Scripts Section in package.json
To use nodemon for automatically restarting the server during development, update the scripts section in your package.json:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
With this setup, you can use npm run dev to start the server with nodemon and have it restart automatically whenever you make changes.
